<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>Suppose there is an issue that appeared. Any user at the company can call, email, message, or go to our osTicket portal site and fill in the form.</p>
<p>Open a New Ticket Form Page:</p>

<br /><br />

<p>Suppose an employee calls our tech employee "Peter" and described the issue.  Peter can begin opening a new ticket into the system:</p>

<br /><br />

<p>After filling out the form, a confirmation page appears indicating a new support ticket was created. Peter can provide updates to the requestor depending on the SLA and severity of the issue.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>This is the same if any other user comes to the company's osTicket system and creates a new ticket.</p>

<p>Next, someone from the company's support team comes to work and begins by logging in to the osTicket Agent portal:</p>

<br /><br />

<p>Once Peter logs in, he will see the following, with the new ticket:</p>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41842e03-df46-4644-8da3-4d9b690f7db9" alt="Agent portal with new ticket" />
<br /><br />

<p>Here, Peter can do many tasks within the Agent portal as he reviews the details of the ticket.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>At this point, Peter or his fellow support staff tends to the issue, resolves it and then closes the ticket:</p>

<p>Ticket is then closed.</p>
